SPINO is a versatile telecommunication solution suitable for nanosatellites and Cubesats.
Operating in UHF and VHF bands, it features tight integration with amateur radio service and the worldwide amateur radio community.
The development of the SPINO SC board was initiated by enthusiats involved in non-profit / educational space projects. Since 2019, 
the project is supported by the joint efforts of two non-profit organizations: AMSAT-Francophone (site.amsat-f.org) and the hackerspace Electrolab (electrolab.fr).

For the context of my projects, I imported SPINO files from the public GitHub (https://code.electrolab.fr/spino/cubesat_cs) for the purpose of having hands on experience in 
generating production files, placing an order from a PCB manufacturing house (JLCPCB), choosing components suitable for the design while soldering some of them 
after the design board is fabricated and delivered and fiinally testing the board in our research lab
